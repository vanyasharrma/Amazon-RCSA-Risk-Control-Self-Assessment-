This project builds a simple Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) to study key operational risks at Amazon. It focuses on cybersecurity threats to AWS and regulatory risks in China and India. The analysis scores each risk based on impact and likelihood, then evaluates how effective existing controls are. The goal is to show how structured risk assessment helps large companies manage uncertainty and make stronger decisions.
